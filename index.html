    <h2 id="whatisf1">What is F1</h2>    
   F1, short for Formula One, is the highest class of open-wheel single-seater racing, sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It's often considered the pinnacle of motorsport and has been the world's premier form of motorsport since its inaugural race in 1950. Formula One consists of a series of races, known as Grand Prix, held on purpose-built circuits or closed roads around the world. 
   
         <h1><strong>How it works:</strong></h1><p><br><br><strong>Practice Sessions:</strong>
Before the main event, teams get time to test and fine-tune their cars in practice sessions. There are typically two practice sessions on Friday and one on Saturday.<br><br>

<strong>Qualifying:</strong>
This session, usually on Saturday, determines the starting grid for the Grand Prix. It's a timed event where drivers try to achieve the fastest lap. <br><br>

<strong>Sprint Races:</strong>
Some race weekends include a sprint race, which also sets the grid for the main race and awards points. <br><br>

<strong>Grand Prix:</strong>
The main event on Sunday is the Grand Prix, where drivers race for the win and championship points. <br><br>

<strong>Points System:</strong>
Points are awarded to the top 10 finishers, with the driver and their team earning points. <br><br>

<strong>Championships:</strong>
Drivers and constructors compete in separate championships, with the top-performing drivers and teams winning titles.

<h1><strong>Why watch?</strong></H1>
    <h2 id="wheat">1:Its more interesting that just cars going in circles</h2>    
    
    <p>Racing in genral has turns that can be sharp like a haipin, or a big round curve. How you take the car over thse corners varies and provides for different passing oppertunities. In addition, an F1 race is not just won on the track; you need the right strategy to get the car through to the finish line. This is a test of human planning, strategizing and managing abilities. A simple mistake here can ruin everything. Thus, motor-racing is not just about going around in circles.</p>

    <h2 id="whywatchexamples">2: Intense battles</h2>
    <p>Intense battles can consist of any two drivers as they move around the track at lightning speeds. One driver is playing defense, trying to force the other driver to not make it past, while the other is trining to cut inside or take a wide line in a corner in order to pass.
</p>

<strong>Notes:</strong><br><br>
Note 1: Best driver (but has a bad car)<br>
note 2:worst driver (always crashes AND bad car)<br>
note 3:Not here to make friends
